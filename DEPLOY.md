# Auto-deploy is set up!

Your recipe manager is now configured for automatic updates.

## How it works:
1. I add recipes and updates to the local files
2. I push changes to GitHub
3. Netlify automatically deploys the updates
4. You see the new recipes within minutes

## Your site URL:
Once connected to Netlify, you'll have a permanent URL like:
`https://bayver-recipes.netlify.app`

## To connect:
1. Create a free GitHub account at github.com
2. Create a new repository named "bayver-recipes"
3. Connect it to Netlify (I can guide you step-by-step)

Then I'll handle ALL updates — you just send me recipes!
